	<h3>2016 Engineering Physics Robot Project</h3>
	<p>
		At UBC, Engineering Physics students take a robotics course that is designed to provide
		prototyping skills. Each year the students are tasked with constructing a robot to solve
		a challenge that the instructors choose for that year. In 2016, the challenge was to make
		and autonomous Uber-Bot that navigated a city, picked up passengers and dropped them off. 
		
		Here is a <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4DFpEfTrKgWTFhaZlZ2aVphZTA"> video</a> 
		of the working robot.
